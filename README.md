## Introduction

This repository aims to help you understand and implement various data structures and algorithms in C++. Each topic includes a detailed explanation, example code, and sample problems to practice.

## Why C++ for DSA ?

C++ is a powerful language that is widely used in competitive programming and software development due to its efficiency and control over system resources. It provides various features such as:

- **Standard Template Library (STL):** Offers a rich set of template classes and functions.
- **Performance:** C++ is known for its high performance and fine-grained control over memory.
- **Flexibility:** Supports both high-level and low-level programming.

## Essential Concept of C and C++ 



To effectively use this repository, a good understanding of the following C++ concepts is recommended:

- **Basic Syntax:** Variables, Data Types, Operators, and Control Flow (if, else, switch, loops)
- [**Functions:**](Functions\Readme.md) Declaration, Definition, Overloading, and Inline Functions
- [**Pointers and References:**](Pointers%20and%20References\Readme.md) Pointer Arithmetic, Dereferencing, Function Pointers, and Reference Variables
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** `new`, `delete`, `malloc`, `free`

- **Templates:** Function Templates, Class Templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL)
- [**Recursion:**](Recursion\Readme.md) Base Cases, Recursive Calls, and Stack Memory Usage
- [**Strings:**](Strings\string.cpp) Manipulation, Functions, and Usage in C++ (`std::string` and C-Style Strings)
