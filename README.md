## Introduction

This repository aims to help you understand and implement various data structures and algorithms in C++. Each topic includes a detailed explanation, example code, and sample problems to practice.

## Why C++ for DSA

C++ is a powerful language that is widely used in competitive programming and software development due to its efficiency and control over system resources. It provides various features such as:

- **Standard Template Library (STL):** Offers a rich set of template classes and functions.
- **Performance:** C++ is known for its high performance and fine-grained control over memory.
- **Flexibility:** Supports both high-level and low-level programming.
